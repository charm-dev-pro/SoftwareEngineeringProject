Notes from a customer's perspective from lab

Our idea: To-do list tracker (Track events and course work)

Ideas:
- upload a PDF and have the app automatically populate information from it
- Can you automatically connect it to an online website such as D2L, Canvas, Teams, etc.
    - Browser plug in application protectors (webscrape)
    - Scan from email and ask to add to the to-do list
    - Add taks to outlook calendar event
- Indepedant application (Coast Guard Task Manager)
    - create own application separate from everything else
    - can decide if want to calendar mode, or task mode, or to-do list mode, etc.
    - Automatically open?
    - Prompt mode where it asks you wuestions like on Sunday to prep for the week (what events are there this week? what course work do you have this week?) and then it formats it all
        - Lunch excusals?    
        - Corps wides/trainings?
        - Course work?
        - Tests?
        - Quizzes?
        - Meetings?
        - Events?
