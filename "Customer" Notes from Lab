Notes from a customer's perspective from lab

Our idea: To-do list tracker (Track events and course work)

Ideas:
- upload a PDF and have the app automatically populate information from it
- Can you automatically connect it to an online website such as D2L, Canvas, Teams, etc.
    - Browser plug in application protectors (webscrape)
    - Scan from email and ask to add to the to-do list
    - Add taks to outlook calendar event
- Indepedant application (Coast Guard Task Manager)
    - create own application separate from everything else
    - can decide if want to calendar mode, or task mode, or to-do list mode, etc.
    - Automatically open?
